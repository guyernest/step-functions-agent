## AI Agent Overview

AI Agents are a combination of LLMs and Tools. Each tool is used to perform a specific task, and the LLM orchestrates them to perform complex tasks, requested by the user. AI Agents are a powerful tool for automating complex tasks in the cloud, and they are a great way to reduce the cost of building and maintaining complex systems. However, the deployment and operation of AI Agents can be a complex process.

This repository provides a robust implementation of AI Agents in AWS Step Functions, which is a serverless computing platform for building and deploying serverless applications. The repository contains the implementation of a few AI Agents:

- SQL AI Agent, which can analyze a SQL database with multiple tables, and answer business questions about the data, including visualization and reporting, in **Python** ![Python Logo](https://cdn.simpleicons.org/python?size=16).
- Financial AI Agent, which can analyze a financial dataset with multiple tables, and answer business questions about the data, including visualization and reporting, in Python ![Python Logo](https://cdn.simpleicons.org/python?size=16), using YFinance library.
- Google Maps AI Agent, which can analyze a Google Maps dataset with multiple tables, and answer business questions about the data, including visualization and reporting, in **TypeScript** ![TypeScript Logo](https://cdn.simpleicons.org/typescript?size=16).
- Time Series Clustering AI Agent, which can analyze a time series dataset with multiple tables, and answer business questions about the data, including visualization and reporting, in **Rust** ![Rust logo](https://cdn.simpleicons.org/rust/gray?size=16).
- Time Series Analysis AI Agent, which can analyze a large set of time series, and answer business questions about the data, including visualization and reporting, in **Java** ![Java Logo](https://img.icons8.com/?size=16&id=13679&format=png&color=000000).
- Web Research AI Agent, which uses Perplexity to analyze web pages, and answer business questions about companies, in **Go** ![Go logo](https://cdn.simpleicons.org/go?size=16).

The implementation should be used as a template for building a custom AI Agent for any specific use case.

### Step Functions Graph for SQL AI Agent

![Step Functions Graph for SQL AI Agent](images/agent_stepfunctions_graph.svg)

## MLOps of AI Agents

There are a few frameworks for MLOps of AI Agents, such as: LangGraph, Crew.ai, Pydanic AI, etc. There are also some cloud platforms that can be used to build and deploy AI Agents, such as Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and Azure OpenAI. There are cons and pros for each of these frameworks and platforms. The proposed implementation of AI Agents in AWS Step Functions is solving most of the problems with the existing frameworks and platforms.

## Comparison with Other AI-Agent Frameworks

The following table compares the proposed implementation of AI Agents in AWS Step Functions with other MLOps frameworks on the aspects of scalability, multi language support, observability, and cost:

| Framework | Scalability | Multi<br/>Language<br/>Support | Multi-LLM<br/>Support | Observability | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI Agents in AWS<br/> Step Functions | High | High | High | High | Low |
| Amazon Bedrock | Medium | Medium | Low | Medium | High |
| LangGraph | Medium | Medium | Medium | Low | High |
| Crew.ai | High | Medium | Medium | Medium | High |
| Pydanic AI | Medium | Medium | Medium | Low | High |

The proposed implementation of AI Agents in AWS Step Functions has many advantages, such as:

- Scalability: High scalability, as the number of tasks that can be executed is limited only by the resources of the AWS account.
- Multi Language Support: The tools can be implemented in any programming language, allowing for the use of the best language for each task.
- Multi-LLM Support: High flexibility in LLM integration, allowing connection to any LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Nova, Llama, etc.) through Lambda functions.
- Observability: High observability, as the state of each task is stored in the Step Function, and can be queried at any time, as well as built-in integration with CloudWatch and X-Ray.
- Cost: Low cost, as the cost of using Serverless Lambda and Step Functions is much lower than using other AI-Agent frameworks.

The other frameworks have some limitations, such as:

- Amazon Bedrock (or Azure AI/ Google AI and other vendor specific): Limited model support, as the number of LLM that can be used is limited (No OpenAI's GPT or Google's Gemini, for example).
- LangGraph: Limited scalability, as the number of tasks that can be executed is limited by the resources of the LangGraph cluster.
- Crew.ai: Great built-in support but limited flexibility for new tools and LLMs.
- Pydanic AI: Limited scalability, as you have to manage the resources of the server where the AI Agent is running.

## AI Agent Implementation

The AI Agent implementation in AWS Step Functions is based on the following steps:

1. Develop Lambda functions which are the tools for the AI Agent. These functions can be used to perform complex tasks, such as calling APIs, querying databases, etc. The functions can be implemented using **any programming language**, such as Python, TypeScript, Java, Rust, etc.
2. Develop Lambda function which calls **your preferred LLM** for the AI Agent.
3. Create a Step Function which orchestrate the AI Agent. This Step Function calls the LLM and passes the request to the tools, and returns the results to the LLM.

This repository contains an example of some tools that are used to build SQL, Financial, Google Maps, and Time Series Clustering Agents. Each Lambda function is implemented under the `lambda` directory. The `CDK` stack integrates all the Lambda functions into the Step Function flow to build the AI Agent.

Please note that each Lambda function is implemented in a dedicated directory and has its own dependencies file. The examples for the different programming languages are:

- ![Python Logo](https://cdn.simpleicons.org/python?size=16) Python: [lambda/tools/graphql-interface](lambda/tools/graphql-interface) - using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to build the requirements.txt file from the requirements.in file, or using SAM template for AWS Lambda.
- ![TypeScript Logo](https://cdn.simpleicons.org/typescript?size=16) TypeScript: [lambda/tools/google-maps](lambda/tools/google-maps) - using tsconfig.json for dependencies.
- ![Rust logo](https://cdn.simpleicons.org/rust/gray?size=16) Rust: [lambda/tools/rust-clustering](lambda/tools/rust-clustering) - using Cargo.toml for dependencies.
- ![Java Logo](https://img.icons8.com/?size=16&id=13679&format=png&color=000000) Java: [lambda/tools/stock-analyzer](lambda/tools/stock-analyzer) - using Maven to build the jar based on the pom.xml.
- ![Go logo](https://cdn.simpleicons.org/go?size=16) Go: [lambda/tools/web-research](lambda/tools/web-research) - using mod.go for dependencies.

## Building Tools

Each tool is implemented using a Lambda function in a dedicated directory, and has its own build requirements and dependencies. You can see more examples and documentation in the [lambda/tools](lambda/tools) folder.

### Using Cookiecutter

The project includes a set of [cookiecutters](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to help you create new tools. You can find them in the [lambda/cookiecutter](lambda/cookiecutter) folder. The cookiecutters are available for Python, TypeScript, and Rust.

To use a cookiecutter, run the following command:

```shell
cd lambda/tools
cookiecutter ../cookiecutter/python # or typescript, or rust
```

### Building from scratch

A tool should know how to parse the tool input, and return the tool output. The tool input is passed to the tool as a JSON object, and the tool output is returned as a JSON object. For example, the following [Lambda function](lambda/tools/db-interface/index.py) implements two tools: `get_db_schema` and `execute_sql_query`:

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Get the tool name from the input event
    tool_use = event
    tool_name = tool_use['name']
    tool_input = tool_use['input']

    db = SQLDatabase(DB_NAME)

    # Once the db is ready, execute the requested method on the db
    match tool_name:
        case 'get_db_schema':
            result = db.get_db_schema()
        case 'execute_sql_query':
            # The SQL provided might cause ad error. We need to return the error message to the LLM
            # so it can fix the SQL and try again.
            try:
                result = db.execute_sql_query(tool_input['sql_query'])
            except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
                result = json.dumps({
                    'error': str(e)
                })
        case _:
            result = json.dumps({
                'error': f"Unknown tool name: {tool_name}"
            })
```

The output of this Lambda function is a JSON object, which is passed to the LLM as the tool output.

```python
return {
      "type": "tool_result",
      "name": tool_name,
      "tool_use_id": tool_use["id"],
      "content": result
}
```

## Building the LLM caller

The LLM caller is implemented using a Lambda function. The LLM caller is called by the `CDK` stack, and it calls the LLM API, with the tools option ("function calling"), and returns the LLM response. Please note that the code below (and in [this repo implementation](lambda/call_llm/README.md)) is the format for:

- [Claude](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use) models from Anthropic.
- [GPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) models from OpenAI.
- [Jamba](https://docs.ai21.com/reference/jamba-15-api-ref) models from AI21, through [AWS Bedrock InvokeModel API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModel.html#API_runtime_InvokeModel_RequestBody).
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) models from Google.
- [XAI](https://x.ai/api/) models from x.ai (aka Grok).
- [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.com/) models from DeepSeek (tool calling is still not supported well, but the code is ready for it).

However, the tool usage is very similar to other LLM, such as FAIR [Llama](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama3_3/prompt_format.md#json-based-tool-calling), etc.

### API Keys

The API keys are stored in AWS Secrets Manager, after they are uploaded from the local `.env` file by the first `cdk deploy` command.

```text
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
AI21_API_KEY=your_ai21_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
... other API keys
```

### Lambda Function

```python
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = json.loads(parameters.get_secret("/ai-agent/api-keys"))["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]
anthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Get system, messages, and model from event
    system = event.get('system')
    messages = event.get('messages')
    tools = event.get('tools', [])

    try:
        response = anthropic_client.messages.create(
            system = system,
            model=model,
            max_tokens=4096,
            tools=tools,
            messages=messages
        )

        assistant_message = convert_claude_message_to_json(response)

        # Update messages to include Claude's response
        messages.append(assistant_message["message"])

        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': {
                'messages': messages,
                'metadata' : assistant_message["metadata"]
            }
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(e)
        return {
            'statusCode': 500,
            'body': json.dumps({
                'error': str(e)
            })
        }
```

## Building the AI Agent Step Function

Once we have the LLM caller, and the tools, we can build the AI Agent Step Function, which is implemented in the `CDK` stack, using the  [stack definition](step_functions_sql_agent/step_functions_sql_agent_stack.py). The stack uses a local construct that reads a [template](step-functions/agent-with-tools-flow-template.json) of the Amazon Step Functions Language (ASL) to create the AI Agent Step Functions Flow. The construct is implemented in the [ai_agent_construct_from_json.py](step_functions_sql_agent/ai_agent_construct_from_json.py) file.

Please note that the template is needed, instead of the CDK constructs for Step Functions, because current constructs for Step Functions do not support JSONata, which is needed to simplify the AI Agent implementation.

### Defining the tools

In the CDK stack we define the tools by following the following steps:

1. Define the IAM role for the Lambda function.

    ```python
        tool_1_role = iam.Role(
            self, "ToolRole",
            assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com")
        )
        # Add relevant permissions to the tool role, such as SSM and Secrets Manager access
        tool_1_role.add_to_policy(
                iam.PolicyStatement(
                    effect=iam.Effect.ALLOW,
                    actions=[
                        "ssm:GetParameter",
                        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
                    ],
                    resources=[
                        f"arn:aws:ssm:{self.region}:{self.account}:parameter/ai-agent/*",
                        f"arn:aws:secretsmanager:{self.region}:{self.account}:secret:/ai-agent/*"
                    ]
                )
            )
    ```

2. Create the Lambda function.

    ```python
            # Create the tool lambda function
            tool_1_lambda_function = _lambda_python.PythonFunction(
                self, "Tool1Lambda",
                function_name="Tool1Lambda",
                description="Tool 1 lambda function",
                entry="lambda/tool1",
                runtime=_lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_12,
                # analyze using aws-lambda-power-tuning to find the best memory size
                memory_size=256,
                index="index.py",
                handler="lambda_handler",
                role=tool_1_role,
            )
    ```

3. Add the Lambda function as tool for the AI Agent.

    ```python
    # Create test tools
            tools = [
                Tool(
                    "get_db_schema",
                    "Describe the schema of the SQLite database, including table names, and column names and types.",
                    tool_1_lambda_function
                ),
                Tool(
                    "execute_sql_query",
                    "Return the query results of the given SQL query to the SQLite database.",
                    tool_2_lambda_function,
                    input_schema={
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "sql_query": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "The sql query to execute against the SQLite database."
                            }
                        },
                        "required": [
                            "sql_query"
                        ]
                    }
                ),
            ]
    ```

## Create the AI Agent Step Function

```python

        system_prompt = """

        agent_flow = ConfigurableStepFunctionsConstruct(
            self,
            "AIStateMachine",
            state_machine_path="step-functions/agent-with-tools-flow-template.json",

                    }
                },
                "required": [
                    "answer",
                    "chart"
                ]
            }
        )
```

## Data Communication

Most of the data communication between the AI Agent and the tools is done using JSON objects, within the message history. However, some raw data such as large images (for example, stock charts), or large datasets (for example, time series data) should be transferred using S3 files. Especially, when the LLM doesn't need to "see" the raw data, the messages to and from the tools can only include a link to the data files in S3, in the form of bucket name and object key.

The following examples of writing CSV files into S3 in Python, and reading CSV files from S3 in Java also demonstrate the flexibility of using different programming languages to build the AI Agent.

### Save data to S3 as tool output

```python
    # Creating a unique file name
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
    csv_key = f'stock_vectors/stock_data_{timestamp}.csv'

    # Save as CSV (for example, other formats can be supported)
    csv_str = '\n'.join(csv_data)

    # Uploading the file to S3
    s3.put_object(
        Bucket=bucket,
        Key=key,
        Body=csv_str
    )

    return json.dumps({
        'bucket': bucket,
        'key': key
    })
```

### Read data from S3 as tool input

```java
    public static class ToolInput {
        @JsonProperty("bucket")
        private String bucket;

        @JsonProperty("key")
        private String key;

        public String getBucket() { return bucket; }

        public void setBucket(String bucket) { this.bucket = bucket; }

        public String getKey() { return key; }

        public void setKey(String key) { this.key = key; }
    }

    // Utility Method to read CSV data from S3
    protected Map<String, List<Double>> readStockDataFromS3(String bucket, String key) {
        Map<String, List<Double>> stockData = new HashMap<>();

        try (S3Object s3Object = s3Client.getObject(bucket, key);
                BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(s3Object.getObjectContent()))) {

            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                String[] values = line.split(",");
                if (values.length > 1) {
                    String ticker = values[0];
                    List<Double> prices = Arrays.stream(values)
                            .skip(1)
                            .map(String::trim)
                            .filter(s -> !s.isEmpty())
                            .map(Double::parseDouble)
                            .collect(Collectors.toList());
                    stockData.put(ticker, prices);
                }
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Error reading from S3: " + e.getMessage(), e);
        }

        return stockData;
    }
```

## Human Approval

One of the main risks of using AI Agents is the potential for the AI to make mistakes. To mitigate this risk, the AI Agent can be configured to require human approval for certain tasks. The AI Agent can be configured to send a message to a human operator, who can review the results of the AI Agent, and approve or reject the results. The AI Agent can then proceed based on the operator's decision.

### Step Functions Graph for SQL AI Agent with Human Approval

![Step Functions Graph for SQL AI Agent](images/agent_with_human_approval.svg)

In this example, the AI Agent is configured to require human approval for the execution of SQL queries. The AI Agent sends a message to the human operator, who can review the SQL query and approve or reject it. The AI Agent then proceeds based on the operator's decision.
The human approval is implemented using a Step Functions activity. The activity is defined in the [SQL Agent Stack](step_functions_agent/step_functions_sql_agent_stack.py) CDK stack.

### Defining the human approval activity

```python
    # Adding human approval to the usage of the tools
    human_approval_activity = sfn.Activity(
        self, "HumanApprovalActivity",
        activity_name="HumanApprovalActivityForSQLQueryExecution",
    )
```

### Adding human approval to the tool definition

The activity is then used in the Step Functions state machine to require human approval for the execution of SQL queries tool:

```python
    Tool(
        "execute_sql_query",
        "Return the query results of the given SQL query to the SQLite database.",
        db_interface_lambda_function,
        input_schema={
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "sql_query": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The sql query to execute against the SQLite database."
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "sql_query"
            ]
        },
        ## Adding human approval to the tool definition
        human_approval_activity=human_approval_activity
    ),
```

### Implementing the human approval UI

Step Functions activities should be polled by a worker process. The simple worker process is implemented in the UI below. You can read more about the implementation in the [AWS Step Functions documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/tutorial-creating-activity-state-machine.html).

## UI for the AI Agent

This repository includes a simple User Interface to the AI Agent, which is implemented using [FastHTML](https://www.fastht.ml/). The UI is a simple web page that allows users to choose the agent they want to use, send a request, and view the message flow and answer.The UI is hosted on AWS App Runner.

![AI Agent UI](images/Agent-AI-UI.png)

The UI is implemented in the [ui](ui) directory, and it is deployed using the [Agent UI](step_functions_agent/agent_ui_stack.py) CDK stack. The UI includes some specific rendering code for some of the tools, such as the visualization creation or the SQL query output. You are welcome to extend the UI to include more tools and more complex rendering.

### Human Approval UI

The human approval UI is implemented in the [ui](ui) directory. The UI is a simple web page that allows the human operator to review the SQL query and approve or reject it.

## Create a new Python tool

To create a new tool, you need to:

1. create a new Lambda function code in the `lambda` directory,

    ```bash
    mkdir lambda/tools/new-tool
    touch lambda/tools/new-tool/index.py
    ```

2. create dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file,

    ```bash
    touch lambda/tools/new-tool/requirements.in
    echo "yfinance" >> lambda/tools/new-tool/requirements.in
    uv pip compile lambda/tools/new-tool/requirements.in --output-file lambda/tools/new-tool/requirements.txt
    ```

3. add the Lambda function code to the stack,

    ```python
            new_tool_lambda_role = iam.Role(
                self, "NewToolLambdaRole",
                assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com"),
                managed_policies=[
                    iam.ManagedPolicy.from_managed_policy_arn(
                        self,
                        "NewToolLambdaPolicy",
                        managed_policy_arn="arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole"
                    )
                ]
            )

            new_tool_lambda_function = _lambda_python.PythonFunction(
                self, "NewToolLambda",
                function_name="NewTool",
                description="New tool lambda function",
                entry="lambda/tools/new-tool",
                runtime=_lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_12,
                timeout=Duration.seconds(90),
                memory_size=512,
                index="index.py",
                handler="lambda_handler",
                architecture=_lambda.Architecture.ARM_64,
                role=new_tool_lambda_role,
            )

    ```

4. create a new tool in the tools list for the AI Agent,

    ```python
    tools = [
            Tool(
                "new_tool",
                "new tool description",
                new_tool_lambda_function,
                provider=LLMProviderEnum.ANTHROPIC
            )
        ]
    ```

## Security

The security of the AI Agent is a critical aspect of the implementation. The following security measures are implemented in tis AI Agent implementation:

1. **IAM Roles and Policies**: The AI Agent uses IAM roles and policies to control access to AWS resources. Using the CDK each lambda function has a specific IAM role that is granted all and only the permissions needed to access the necessary AWS resources, such as S3, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, etc. The Step Function also has an IAM role that is granted the necessary permissions to execute the Lambda functions, or other Step Functions (other AI Agents).s
2. **Secrets Manager**: The AI Agent uses AWS Secrets Manager to store sensitive information, such as API keys. The AI Agent retrieves the API keys from Secrets Manager at runtime, and uses them to access external services. Please note that using the Secrets Manager is a more secure way for the API keys than hardcoding them in the code, or passing them as environment variables, which are more visible for Lambda functions operators.

## Pre-requisites

1. [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
2. [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
3. [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)

## Building and Testing with Make

This project includes a comprehensive Makefile to simplify the build and test process for all components. The Makefile handles multiple programming languages and provides various targets for building, testing, and deployment preparation.

### Main Make Targets

```bash
make              # Runs all steps (clean, setup, build, test)
make setup        # Sets up all environments and creates .env file
make build        # Builds all lambda functions
make test         # Runs tests for all components
make clean        # Cleans build artifacts and temporary files
make deploy-prep  # Prepares for deployment (clean, setup, build, test)
```

### Language-Specific Targets

For building specific language components:
```bash
make build-python      # Build Python lambda functions
make build-typescript  # Build TypeScript lambda functions
make build-rust        # Build Rust lambda functions
make build-java        # Build Java lambda functions
make build-go         # Build Go lambda functions
```

For running tests for specific languages:
```bash
make test-python      # Run Python tests
make test-typescript  # Run TypeScript tests
make test-rust       # Run Rust tests
make test-java       # Run Java tests
make test-go         # Run Go tests
```

### Environment Setup

The `make setup` command will:
1. Create a .env file if it doesn't exist (you need to update it with your actual API keys)
2. Set up virtual environments for Python using uv
3. Install dependencies for TypeScript/Node.js
4. Build Rust projects
5. Handle Java Maven builds
6. Set up Go modules

### Deployment Preparation

Before deploying with CDK, run:
```bash
make deploy-prep  # This will clean, setup, build, and test everything
cdk deploy       # Then deploy with CDK
```

## uv Set up

An easy way to deploy Lambda functions is to have a requirements.txt file in the same directory as the Lambda function (`index.py`, for example). Using `uv` is the great way to build that requirements.txt file, from the requirements.in file. For example:

```shell
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip compile lambda/db-interface/requirements.in --output-file lambda/db-interface/requirements.txt
```

The `CDK` stack will use Docker to build the Lambda functions, and it will use the requirements.txt file to install the required Python packages, into the format of zip file, and deploy it to the Cloud.

## Deploying the AI Agent Step Function using CDK

The CDK Stack defines all the necessary resources to deploy the AI Agent Step Function, including the IAM roles, Secrets Manager secrets (for API keys), Lambda functions (tools and LLM caller), and Step Functions.

```shell
cdk deploy --all
```

### Other CDK commands

```shell
cdk list
cdk synth SQLAgentStack
cdk synth FinancialAgentStack
cdk diff SQLAgentStack
cdk diff FinancialAgentStack
```

## Monitoring

### CloudWatch Logs

The CDK stack defines a log group that can be used for all the Lambda functions. The log group is created with a retention period of 7 days, which can be changed in the CDK stack definition.

The project includes a [CloudWatch and X-ray AI Agent](step_functions_agent/step_functions_cloudwatch_agent_stack.py) that can check issues in the log and analyze the traces.

### X-Ray

The CDK stack defines a X-Ray tracing for all the Lambda functions. The X-Ray tracing is enabled by default. The X-Ray traces can be viewed in the AWS X-Ray console.

![Service Map Graph for SQL AI Agent](images/AI-Agents-Traces-Service-Map.png)

### CloudWatch Dashboards

The [CDK Monitoring stack](step_functions_agent/agent_monitoring_stack.py) defines a CloudWatch dashboard that can be used to monitor the Lambda functions.
