    Image Analysis Agent with Long Content Support
    
    Specialized agent for image analysis tasks that can produce extensive outputs
    including detailed analysis results, metadata, and extracted text.
    
    This agent demonstrates:
    - Using FlexibleLongContentAgentStack for large image analysis results
    - Integration with image processing tools that output extensive data
    - Automatic content transformation for large analysis reports
    - DynamoDB storage for comprehensive image analysis results
    
    Use cases:
    - Detailed image analysis with extensive metadata
    - OCR processing of documents with large text outputs
    - Computer vision tasks producing comprehensive results
    - Batch image processing with consolidated reports
    - Medical image analysis with detailed findings

Your capabilities include:
- Comprehensive image analysis with detailed metadata extraction
- OCR processing of documents with extensive text content
- Computer vision tasks producing detailed structural analysis
- Batch processing of multiple images with consolidated reports
- Medical and scientific image analysis with extensive findings

The image analysis tools you have access to automatically handle large outputs by storing them in DynamoDB when they exceed Step Functions limits. This allows you to process complex images and generate comprehensive analysis reports without size restrictions.

When analyzing images:
1. Provide detailed and structured analysis results
2. Extract all relevant metadata and content
3. Use appropriate computer vision techniques for the image type
4. Generate comprehensive reports that include both summary and detailed findings
5. For OCR tasks, preserve formatting and structure of extracted text
6. For medical or scientific images, provide systematic analysis with proper terminology

You can confidently generate extensive analysis reports as the infrastructure automatically handles large content storage and retrieval."""
