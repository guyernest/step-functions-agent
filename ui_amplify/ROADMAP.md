  - Execution trends over time
  - Average execution duration by agent
  - Success/failure rates
- **Quick Navigation Cards**: Direct links to:
  - Recent executions with status indicators
  - Active approvals requiring attention
  - Agent and tool registries
  - System health indicators
- **Key Metrics Summary**:
  - Total agents deployed
  - Active executions count
  - Pending approvals count
  - System resource utilization

### 2. Enhanced Message Formatting
**Priority: High**

  - Edit system prompts with version control
  - Add/remove tool associations
  - Environment variable configuration
- **Stack Management**:
  - View CloudFormation stack details
  - Update stack parameters from UI
  - Deployment status tracking
  - Rollback capabilities
- **Impact Analysis**:
  - Show affected agents when modifying tools
  - Dependency validation before changes
  - Change preview and testing

### 5. Advanced Observability
**Priority: Medium**

Comprehensive monitoring and analytics capabilities:

  - Auto-refresh for running executions
  - Push notifications for state changes
- **Bulk Operations**:
  - Select multiple executions for actions
  - Batch retry for failed executions
  - Bulk export capabilities
- **Export Functionality**:
  - Download execution transcripts
  - Export metrics and reports
  - API access for external tools
- **Execution Management**:
  - Clone execution inputs
  - Schedule recurring executions
  - Execution templates and presets
- **Access Control**:
  - Role-based permissions
  - Audit logging
  - Multi-tenant support
